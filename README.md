# GooseNeck Bot Project

</div>


## Description
For this project, our team decided to try something new and create a Discord Bot. Essentially, this is a computer that you can interact with on the Discord platform in any server that you invite it to. It has many different functions and commands that it can run, but it only works if the users themselves type in the commands. GooseNeck Bot’s main purpose is currently a gacha game. This means that once he is in your server, you can type a command to register your discord account, gain in game currency, and roll for random cards with random rarities. You are not able to use some of the bot’s mechanics without registering first because registering allows us to store what cards you roll and how much money you have in our game. If you are less interested in our game, you can always check out the other functions of our bot such as, receiving a random inspirational quote and checking DogeCoin crypto currency prices. In addition to our bot, we also have a website that you can visit that tells you more about the bot and the creators. It also provides a way to invite the bot to other servers so you can enjoy our gacha game in more than one place.


## How to run

1. Go to discord and create an account or log in.
2. Once you are logged in, locate a “+” symbol on the left side of the screen and add a server.
3. A screen will appear and you need to select “Create My Own”
4. Then select “For me and my friends”
5. Give it a name and select create
6. From here we can go to the GooseNeck website and invite the bot to our server.
7. Once you click “Invite the Bot”, you will be brought to a new page where you can select which server you want to invite GooseNeck Bot to.
8. Hit continue, Authorize, and authorize your discord account.
9. GooseNeck should appear on your server now and you can begin using the implemented commands.
10. Type “.help”, “.hep”, and/or “.hep_cmd” to see everything you can do!

## Side Note
There is no code that you physically need to run for our bot. Once you invite it to your server, all the code will run by itself. If we the creators change/add to our bot, GooseNeck Bot will go offline and update once we finish with maintenance. This means that the bot will automatically update itself with our new code without you needing to do anything!
